#' @format The Bayesian network \code{fire_alarm} comprehends the following nodes:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \bold{Fire}: two-level factor with levels \emph{TRUE} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates presence or absence of a fire.
#'   \item \bold{Smoke}: two level-factor with levels \emph{TRUE} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates if the alarm system has been tampered or not.
#'   \item \bold{Alarm}: three level-factor with levels \emph{TRUE}, \emph{MALFUNCTION} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates presence or absence of smoke.
#'   \item \bold{Tampering}: two level-factor with levels \emph{TRUE} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates if the alarm is ringing, malfunctioning or not ringing.
#'   \item \bold{Leaving}: two level-factor with levels \emph{TRUE} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates if the building is being evacuated or not.
