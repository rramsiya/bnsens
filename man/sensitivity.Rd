\usage{
sensitivity(bnfit, interest_node, interest_node_value,
  evidence_nodes = NULL, evidence_states = NULL, node, value_node,
  value_parents, new_value, covariation = "orderp", plot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{bnfit}{object of class bn.fit}

\item{interest_node}{character string. Node of the probability query of interest.}

\item{interest_node_value}{character string. Level of \code{interest_node}}

\item{evidence_nodes}{character string. Evidence nodes. If \code{NULL} no evidence is considerated. Set by default to \code{NULL}.}

\item{evidence_states}{character string. Levels of \code{evidence_nodes}. If \code{NULL} no evidence is considerated. If \code{evidence_nodes="NULL"}, \code{evidence_states} should be set to \code{NULL}. Set by default to \code{NULL}.}

\item{node}{character string. Node of which the conditional probability distribution is being changed.}

\item{value_node}{character string. Level of \code{node}.}

\item{value_parents}{character string. Levels of \code{node}'s parents. The levels should be defined according to the order of the parents in \code{bnfit[[node]][["parents"]]}. If \code{node} has no parents, then should be set to \code{NULL}.}

\item{new_value}{numeric vector with elements between 0 and 1. Values to which the parameter should be updated. It can take a specific value or more than one. In the case in which the user wants to consider more than one value,these should be defined through a vector with an increasing order of the elements. \code{new_value} can also take as value the character string \code{all}: in this case a sequence of possible parameter changes ranging from 0.05 to 0.95 will be considered.}

\item{covariation}{character string. Covariation scheme to be used for the updated Bayesian network. Can take values \code{uniform}, \code{proportional}, \code{orderp}, \code{all}.If equal to \code{all}, uniform, proportional and order-preserving co-variation schemes will be considered. Set by default to \code{proportional}.}

\item{plot}{boolean value. If \code{TRUE} the function returns a plot. If \code{covariation = "all"}, sensitivity function for uniform (red), proportional (green), order-preserving (blue) co-variation schemes will be plotted.  Set by default to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to be added to the plot.}
}
\description{
\code{sensitivity} returns the sensitivity function for a probabilistic query of interest with respect to a parameter change defined by the user.
}
\details{
\cr
The Bayesian network on which parameter variation is being conducted should be expressed as a bn.fit object.
The name of the node to be varied, its level and its parent's level should be specified.
The parameter variation specified by the function is:\cr
\cr
 P ( \code{node} = \code{value_node} | parents = \code{value_parents} ) = \code{new_value} \cr
\cr
and the probabilistic query of interest is:\cr
\cr
 P ( \code{interest_node} = \code{interest_node_value} | \code{evidence_nodes} = \code{evidence_states} ) \cr
