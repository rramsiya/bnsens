\title{Bayesian network on fire alarm system}
\format{The Bayesian network \code{fire_alarm} comprehends the following nodes:
\itemize{
  \item \bold{Fire}: two-level factor with levels \emph{TRUE} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates presence or absence of a fire.
  \item \bold{Smoke}: two level-factor with levels \emph{TRUE} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates if the alarm system has been tampered or not.
  \item \bold{Alarm}: three level-factor with levels \emph{TRUE}, \emph{MALFUNCTION} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates presence or absence of smoke.
  \item \bold{Tampering}: two level-factor with levels \emph{TRUE} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates if the alarm is ringing, malfunctioning or not ringing.
  \item \bold{Leaving}: two level-factor with levels \emph{TRUE} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates if the building is being evacuated or not.
  \item \bold{Report}: two level-factor with levels \emph{TRUE} and \emph{FALSE}. Indicates if the incident has been reported or not.
