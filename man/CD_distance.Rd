\usage{
CD_distance(bnfit, node, value_node, value_parents, new_value,
  covariation = "proportional", plot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{bnfit}{object of class bn.fit}

\item{node}{character string. Node of which the conditional probability distribution is being changed.}

\item{value_node}{character string. Level of \code{node}.}

\item{value_parents}{character string. Levels of \code{node}'s parents. The levels should be defined for the parents in the order found in \code{bnfit[[node]][["parents"]]}. If \code{node} has no parents, then should be set to \code{NULL}.}

\item{new_value}{numeric vector with elements between 0 and 1. Values to which the parameter should be updated. It can take a specific value or more than one. In the case in which more than one value are being defined, the vector should have an increasing order of the elements. \code{new_value} can take also as value the character string \code{all}. If \code{all}, a sequence of possible parameter changes ranging from 0.05 to 0.95 will be considered.}

\item{covariation}{character string. Covariation scheme to be used for the updated Bayesian network. Can take values \code{uniform}, \code{proportional}, \code{orderp}, \code{all}.If equal to \code{all}, uniform, proportional and order-preserving co-variation schemes will be considered. Set by default to \code{proportional}.}

\item{plot}{boolean value. If \code{TRUE} the function returns a plot. If \code{covariation = "all"}, CD-distance for uniform (red), proportional (green), order-preserving (blue) co-variation schemes will be plotted.  Set by default to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to be added to the plot.}

\description{
\code{CD_distance} returns the Chan-Darwiche distance between a Bayesian network and its update after parameter variation.
}
\details{
\cr
The Bayesian network on which parameter variation is being conducted should be expressed as a bn.fit object.
The name of the node to be varied, its level and its parent's level should be specified.
The parameter variation specified by the function is:\cr
\cr
 P ( \code{node} = \code{value_node} | parents = \code{value_parents} ) = \code{new_value} \cr
