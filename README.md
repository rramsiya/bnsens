# BNSENS

bnsens is an R package able to perform sensitivity analysis on BNs (Bayesian Networks).<br/> A range of functions is provided, able to change co-variance schemes of BNs, compute a range of dissimilarity measures and perform queries on the conditional probability tables.

### Careful:
Before installing bnsens, install package RBGL from BioConductor.

### More details:
This project has been realized as my Bachelor thesis in Statistics at University of Glasgow. <br/>
